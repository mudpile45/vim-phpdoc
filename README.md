vim-phpdoc
==========

Makes PHP's documentation available at a keystroke from anywhere in VIM

This is just Fumbling In the Dark's
[guide](http://www.fumbling-in-the-dark.com/2011/03/viewing-php-manual-in-vim.html)
repackaged as a vim plugin for easier consumption. 

Usage
=====
Install the plugin (ideally via Pathogen or another vim plugin manager) and hit
K over any php command. A VIM help window will appear showing you how to use
it. 

Origin
======
This is taken from a
[guide](http://www.fumbling-in-the-dark.com/2011/03/viewing-php-manual-in-vim.html)
posted on posted on Fumbling in the Dark's blog. The original site seems not to
be maintained as the google docs the files are hosted on are in the trash. 

The original source files and directions on how to generate an updated version
of the phpdocs are in a separate repo
[here](http://github.com/mudpile45/vim-phpdoc-generator).
